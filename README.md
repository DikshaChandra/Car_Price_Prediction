# Car_Price_Prediction

Business Goal:

we are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with respect to the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. The model will act as a better medium for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Following steps will be followed to reach our goal:

- Importing libraries
- Reading the concerned dataset
- Data Understanding
- Data handling
- Data visualization
- Data preparation
- Splitting the Data and feature scaling
- Building a linear regression model
- Residual analysis of the train data
- Making Predictions Using the Final Model
- Model Evaluation
- Conclusion
